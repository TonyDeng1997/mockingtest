jQuery provides several methods for AJAX functionality.

With the jQuery AJAX methods, you can request text, HTML, 
XML, or JSON from a remote server using both HTTP Get and HTTP Post - And 
you can load the external data directly into the selected HTML elements of
your web page!

Writing regular AJAX code can be a bit tricky, because different browsers 
have different syntax for AJAX implementation. This means that you will have
to write extra code to test for different browsers. However, the jQuery team 
has taken care of this for us, so that we can write AJAX functionality with 
only one single line of code.

The load() method loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element.

Syntax:

data is optional.
callback is optional and it is executed when the load is completed.
